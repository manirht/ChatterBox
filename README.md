## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run ChatterBox locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* `Node.js`: v16+ (LTS recommended)
* `npm`: v8+ (comes with Node.js)
* `MongoDB`: A running instance of MongoDB (local or cloud-hosted)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/manirht/ChatterBox.git](https://github.com/manirht/ChatterBox.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ChatterBoxn # Based on the clone URL, the folder will likely be 'ChatterBox'
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # If frontend and backend are separate, you might need to do:
    # cd frontend && npm install && cd ../backend && npm install
    ```
4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or specific frontend/backend directories if structured separately).
    * Define the following variables:
        ```
        PORT=3000
        MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
        ```

### Running the Application

* **Command:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    *(Note: This assumes `npm run dev` script handles both frontend and backend startup, or you might need separate commands like `npm start` for each part if they are in different sub-directories.)*

## Usage

* Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or your specified port).
* Sign up for a new account or log in if you already have one.
* Start chatting with other users in real-time!
